      <h3>500cc Snowmobile Engine Restoration</h3>
      <p>
  Restored a non-running 500cc snowmobile engine through complete teardown, inspection,
  and failure analysis. Diagnosed root causes by evaluating internal components and wear,
  then developed and executed a repair plan. Reassembled the engine following proper
  procedures and specifications, returning it to reliable operating condition.

      <h3>1978 Yamaha XS400 Restoration</h3>
      <p>
  Restoring a non-running 1978 Yamaha XS400 through systematic diagnostics, repair,
  and mechanical troubleshooting. Identified and resolved issues preventing operation,
  returning the motorcycle to a running condition. Current work focuses on engine
  tuning, performance refinement, and aesthetic restoration to improve reliability
  and overall condition.

      <h3>Baja SAE – Controls Lead</h3>
      <p>
  Served as Controls Lead for a Baja SAE vehicle, overseeing the design, integration,
  and testing of throttle, braking, and shifting systems. Worked closely with team
  members to diagnose issues, refine system performance, and ensure reliable operation
  under competition conditions. This role emphasized hands-on system integration,
  troubleshooting, and collaborative engineering design.

      <h3>Yamaha TTR & YZ Motorcycle Service</h3>
      <p>
  Performed mechanical repairs and maintenance on Yamaha TTR and YZ motorcycles,
  including engine case repair, valve service, and timing chain and tensioner
  replacement. Diagnosed mechanical issues through inspection and testing, then
  executed repairs to restore proper engine operation. This work emphasized engine
  timing, valvetrain function, and hands-on mechanical troubleshooting.

      <h3>Digital Multimeter Assembly & Calibration</h3>
      <p>
  Assembled a digital multimeter by populating and soldering a printed circuit board
  based on provided schematics. Calibrated the instrument to specified reference values
  and verified proper operation across measurement modes through functional testing.
  The multimeter performed as intended, confirming correct assembly, calibration,
  and measurement accuracy.

      <h3>SolidWorks Dice Design</h3>
      <p>
  Designed a multi-material die in SolidWorks using parametric modeling, custom features,
  and mass-property analysis to achieve an evenly weighted final part. Adjusted hole
  placement, face thicknesses, and material selections to balance the center of mass
  and minimize bias. Verified mass distribution, volume, surface area, and principal
  moments of inertia using SolidWorks analysis tools, iterating until the die met
  functional weighting requirements.
