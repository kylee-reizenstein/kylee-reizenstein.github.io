      <h3>500cc Snowmobile Engine Restoration</h3>
      <p>
        Restored a non-running 500cc snowmobile engine through complete teardown, inspection,
        and failure analysis. Diagnosed root causes by evaluating internal components and wear,
        then developed and executed a repair plan. Reassembled the engine following proper
        procedures and specifications, returning it to reliable operating condition.

      <h3>1978 Yamaha XS400 Restoration</h3>
      <p>
        Restoring a non-running 1978 Yamaha XS400 through systematic diagnostics, repair, and
        mechanical troubleshooting. Identified and resolved issues preventing operation,
        returning the motorcycle to a running condition. Current work focuses on engine tuning,
        performance refinement, and aesthetic restoration to improve reliability and overall condition.

      <h3>Baja SAE – Controls Lead</h3>
      <p>
        Served as Controls Lead for a Baja SAE vehicle, overseeing the design, integration, and
        testing of throttle, braking, and shifting systems. Worked closely with team members to
        diagnose issues, refine system performance, and ensure reliable operation under competition
        conditions. This role emphasized hands-on system integration, troubleshooting, and collaborative
        engineering design.

      <h3>Yamaha TTR &amp; YZ Motorcycle Service</h3>
      <p>
        Performed mechanical repairs and maintenance on Yamaha TTR and YZ motorcycles, including engine
        case repair, valve service, and timing chain and tensioner replacement. Diagnosed mechanical issues
        through inspection and testing, then executed repairs to restore proper engine operation. This work
        emphasized engine timing, valvetrain function, and hands-on mechanical troubleshooting.

      <h3>Digital Multimeter Assembly &amp; Calibration</h3>
      <p>
        Assembled a digital multimeter by populating and soldering a printed circuit board based on provided
        schematics. Calibrated the instrument to specified reference values and verified proper operation
        across measurement modes through functional testing. The multimeter performed as intended, confirming
        correct assembly, calibration, and measurement accuracy.

    <div>
      <h3>SolidWorks Dice Design</h3>
      <p>
        Designed a multi-material die in SolidWorks using parametric modeling, custom features, and mass-property
        analysis to achieve an evenly weighted final part. Adjusted hole placement, face thicknesses, and material
        selections to balance the center of mass and minimize bias. Verified mass distribution, volume, surface area,
        and principal moments of inertia using SolidWorks analysis tools, iterating until the die met functional
        weighting requirements.
